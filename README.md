# advent_of_code

This is a repo for me to keep my most recent solution to advent of code.
Currently, the project is in Python, but could expend to most language if I
want to try and tackle a different challenge.

## Structure

All the code is in the `./src/<language>` directory. All days have there
separate files. So `./src/python/2022/day_1.py` is day 1 of the 2022 advent of
code.

At the same time, data for the advent of code challenge is in the data folder
under the same structure.
